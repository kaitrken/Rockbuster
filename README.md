SQL queries for online streaming data for CareerFoundry Data Immersion course

# Project Objective
The imaginary company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, is planning to launch an online video streaming service to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime. In developing their 2020 company strategy they want information on the most popular videos and genres, where the highest lifetime value customers are based, and average rental durations. I created a data dictionary and used SQL queries to clean the data and create tables. This project culminated in a presentation that answered the questions put forth by the Business Intelligence department to contribute to their 2020 strategy.
